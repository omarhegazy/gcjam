PROBLEM
=======

In this problem, you start with 0 cookies. You gain cookies at a rate of 2 cookies per second, by clicking on a giant cookie. Any time you have at least C cookies, you can buy a cookie farm. Every time you buy a cookie farm, it costs you C cookies and gives you an extra F cookies per second.

Once you have X cookies that you haven't spent on farms, you win! Figure out how long it will take you to win if you use the best possible strategy.

Example

Suppose C=500.0, F=4.0 and X=2000.0. Here's how the best possible strategy plays out:

You start with 0 cookies, but producing 2 cookies per second.
After 250 seconds, you will have C=500 cookies and can buy a farm that produces F=4 cookies per second.
After buying the farm, you have 0 cookies, and your total cookie production is 6 cookies per second.
The next farm will cost 500 cookies, which you can buy after about 83.3333333 seconds.
After buying your second farm, you have 0 cookies, and your total cookie production is 10 cookies per second.
Another farm will cost 500 cookies, which you can buy after 50 seconds.
After buying your third farm, you have 0 cookies, and your total cookie production is 14 cookies per second.
Another farm would cost 500 cookies, but it actually makes sense not to buy it: instead you can just wait until you have X=2000 cookies, which takes about 142.8571429 seconds.
Total time: 250 + 83.3333333 + 50 + 142.8571429 = 526.1904762 seconds.
Notice that you get cookies continuously: so 0.1 seconds after the game starts you'll have 0.2 cookies, and π seconds after the game starts you'll have 2π cookies.

INPUT
=====

The first line of the input gives the number of test cases, T. T lines follow. Each line contains three space-separated real-valued numbers: C, F and X, whose meanings are described earlier in the problem statement.

C, F and X will each consist of at least 1 digit followed by 1 decimal point followed by from 1 to 5 digits. There will be no leading zeroes.

OUTPUT
======

For each test case, output one line containing "Case #x: y", where x is the test case number (starting from 1) and y is the minimum number of seconds it takes before you can have X delicious cookies.

We recommend outputting y to 7 decimal places, but it is not required. y will be considered correct if it is close enough to the correct number: within an absolute or relative error of 10-6. See the FAQ for an explanation of what that means, and what formats of real numbers we accept.
